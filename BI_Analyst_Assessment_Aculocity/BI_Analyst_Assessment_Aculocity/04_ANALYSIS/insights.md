## ANALYSIS

1. Key insights for the Autocar Sales Team

The data shows that a relatively small group of large fleet customers controls a significant share of total vehicles in Alabama. Fleets with 20+ vehicles represent the highest opportunity and are the most efficient targets for sales outreach.

Vehicles with engine sizes greater than 10L are heavily concentrated within these larger fleets, directly aligning with Autocar’s current inventory. The most common makes across high-volume fleets are Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack, and Volvo, which helps inform competitive positioning and trade-in discussions.

An `Is Construction` flag was added to identify customers aligned with Autocar’s construction strategy, allowing sales to quickly focus on the most relevant accounts.

2. Top 10 customers to call first (≥20 vehicles >10L)

To support immediate sales, customers were filtered to include only those with at least 20 vehicles with engine sizes greater than 10L. These customers were then ranked by total vehicles >10L, ensuring outreach is prioritized toward accounts most likely to convert quickly.

This approach:

- Aligns directly with available inventory
- Focuses on high-volume, high-impact customers
- Provides a clear, defensible call list for sales

The “Top 10 Customers to Call First (≥20 Vehicles >10L)” table in the dashboard reflects this final prioritized list.
